Shell basics refer to the fundamental concepts and commands used in Unix-like operating systems to interact with the shell, which is a command-line interface that allows users to execute commands and run programs.

The shell provides a way for users to interact with the operating system and execute commands using a command-line interface. Some of the basic commands and concepts used in the shell include:

1. Filesystem navigation: Users can navigate the file system using commands such as "cd" (change directory) to navigate to a different directory, "ls" to list the files in the current directory, and "pwd" to print the current working directory.

2. File and directory manipulation: Users can create, copy, move, and delete files and directories using commands such as "touch" to create a new file, "cp" to copy a file, "mv" to move a file, and "rm" to delete a file.

3. Input and output redirection: Users can redirect input and output using symbols such as ">" to redirect output to a file, "<" to take input from a file, and "|" to pipe the output of one command into the input of another command.

4. Permissions: Users can set permissions on files and directories using commands such as "chmod" to change the permissions of a file or directory.

5. Environment variables: Users can set and view environment variables using commands such as "export" to set a new environment variable and "echo" to view the value of an existing environment variable.

6. Text manipulation: Users can manipulate text using commands such as "grep" to search for a pattern in a file, "sed" to perform text substitutions, and "awk" to process text data.

These are just a few examples of the basic commands and concepts used in the shell. By mastering these basics, users can interact with the shell more effectively and perform a wide variety of tasks, from navigating the file system to managing processes and running complex scripts.
