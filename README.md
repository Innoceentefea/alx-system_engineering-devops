System engineering DevOps is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and automation between software development and IT operations teams. 

In traditional software development, developers write code and hand it off to operations teams to deploy and maintain the software in production. This often results in inefficiencies and delays due to communication gaps and handoffs between teams.

DevOps aims to break down these silos by encouraging developers and operations teams to work together to develop and deploy software more efficiently. System engineering DevOps extends this approach by focusing on the design and management of complex systems, including software applications, infrastructure, and networks.

System engineering DevOps combines principles of Agile software development, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), and automation to build and deploy software systems quickly and reliably. This approach emphasizes the use of tools and processes that enable teams to collaborate and coordinate their work, such as version control, continuous testing, and continuous monitoring.

Overall, system engineering DevOps aims to improve the speed, quality, and reliability of software development and deployment by fostering a culture of collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement between developers and operations teams.
