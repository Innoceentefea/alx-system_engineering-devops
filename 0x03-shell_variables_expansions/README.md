Shell variables expansion refers to the process of replacing a variable name with its value in a shell command or script. In Unix-like operating systems, shell variables are used to store data that can be accessed and manipulated by shell commands and scripts. 

There are several types of shell variables, including environment variables, local variables, and positional parameters. Environment variables are global variables that are available to all processes running in the shell, while local variables are only available within the current shell session or script. Positional parameters are special variables that hold arguments passed to a shell script or function.

The shell performs variable expansion by replacing the variable name with its value when the command or script is executed. Variable expansion is initiated by prefixing the variable name with a dollar sign ($). For example, if a variable named "name" is defined with the value "John", the command "echo $name" will output the string "John".

In addition to simple variable expansion, the shell supports several types of expansion that enable users to manipulate and transform variable values. Some common types of variable expansion include:

1. Command substitution: This allows the output of a command to be used as a variable value. Command substitution is performed by enclosing the command in backticks (`) or using the $(command) syntax.

2. Arithmetic expansion: This allows arithmetic operations to be performed on numeric variables. Arithmetic expansion is performed by enclosing the expression in $((expression)) syntax.

3. Parameter expansion: This allows users to manipulate variable values by removing or replacing parts of the value. Parameter expansion is performed by enclosing the variable name in ${} syntax.

Variable expansion is a powerful feature of shell scripting and enables users to build dynamic and flexible scripts that can adapt to changing conditions and inputs. By understanding the basics of variable expansion and its various forms, users can write more effective and efficient shell scripts.
