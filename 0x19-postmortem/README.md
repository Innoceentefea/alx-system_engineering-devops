 postmortem, also known as a post-incident review or retrospective, is a structured analysis and documentation process that takes place after an incident, outage, or significant issue within a system, service, or organization. Its purpose is to thoroughly understand the incident, identify its root causes, and derive actionable insights to prevent similar incidents in the future. While postmortems are commonly associated with software development and IT operations, they can be applied to any field or industry where incidents occur.

The primary goals of a postmortem are:

1. Understanding the Incident: The postmortem aims to provide a clear and comprehensive understanding of what occurred during the incident. This includes identifying the symptoms, impact, and timeline of events leading up to and during the incident.

2. Identifying Root Causes: The postmortem seeks to uncover the underlying factors and root causes that contributed to the incident. This involves identifying technical issues, misconfigurations, process failures, human errors, or any other factors that played a role in the incident's occurrence.

3. Learning and Improvement: The postmortem process fosters a culture of learning and improvement by analyzing the incident in detail. It provides an opportunity to reflect on the incident, identify areas for improvement, and implement corrective and preventative measures to mitigate similar incidents in the future.

The typical structure of a postmortem includes the following sections:

1. Issue Summary: A concise summary that provides an overview of the incident, including the duration, impact, and affected systems or services. This section is usually written in a way that can be understood by executives and stakeholders who may not have technical expertise.

2. Timeline: A chronological sequence of events that highlights the key moments and actions taken before, during, and after the incident. The timeline helps establish a clear understanding of how the incident unfolded and how the response evolved.

3. Root Cause and Resolution: A detailed analysis of the root cause(s) that led to the incident. This section examines the technical, procedural, and human factors involved and explains how the issue was ultimately resolved.

4. Corrective and Preventative Measures: A list of actionable steps and recommendations aimed at addressing the root causes and preventing similar incidents in the future. These measures can include process improvements, infrastructure changes, additional monitoring, training, or any other relevant actions.

Postmortems are not meant to assign blame or point fingers at individuals or teams. Instead, they focus on understanding the complex system interactions and factors that contributed to the incident. The process encourages open and honest communication, fosters a blame-free culture, and promotes collaboration in finding solutions.

To make postmortems more effective, it is essential to document and share the findings within the organization. This allows teams to learn from each other's experiences, build institutional knowledge, and continuously improve the reliability and resilience of systems and services.

In summary, a postmortem is a structured analysis and documentation process that aims to understand incidents, identify root causes, and drive continuous improvement. By conducting postmortems, organizations can learn from their mistakes, prevent future incidents, and build more robust and reliable systems.
